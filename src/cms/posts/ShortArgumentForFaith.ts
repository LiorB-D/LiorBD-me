It is a waste of time to try and prove the scientific validity of faith. The point of faith is not to be logically robust.

Faith is a vehicle for happiness; It’s a vehicle for community; It’s a vehicle for comfort in the midst of the lowest points in life.

Humans are particularly great at buying into fictional systems that bring us emotional utility.

We are happy when Harry defeats Voldemort or when Superman saves the day.

We are completely conscious that these characters are fictional characters, and yet **we care** because **we are better off for caring**.
