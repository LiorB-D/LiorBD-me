Love that asks nothing of you is not love,

Nor can life without labor be called life at all.

Oh this world won't trade much any value 

without something valued in its place.

<br/>

So forfeit your mounds of time and energy

and get cathedrals of beauty and grace.

If you choose to cling to peace,
you'll get your peace in Death alone.

But Death's claws are deadly a price,
to pay for not so precious peace.
